# 🏥🆔 Medical ID Template

This year I got a diagnosis and my doctor issued a medical ID - but it was handwritten and in German. I was really afraid of what would happen if I was abroad and the doctor had no idea what it said.

## Research for ICE / Medical ID templates

I was looking for Medical IDs / ICE (In Case of Emergency) - templates that look pleasling, official and are easy to fill in. After some research I decided to create my own - and now you can use it as well.

Just duplicate the Figma file and use it for your very personal Medical ID

- Responsive layout
- Add as many conditions / emergency contacts as you like, the document is flexible
